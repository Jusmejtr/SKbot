# SK bot

My project, which I created during high school in my free time for my Discord server.

The Discord bot was made with JavaScript on Node.js.

Bot currently running on discord.js v14. Newly supports some slash command but not many.

Functions:

- economy system
- game updates
- mod functions (kick/ban)
- play music

# How to run

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit all fields
3. Rename `serviceAccount-example.json` to `serviceAccount.json` and edit or upload Firebase SDK key
4. Start bot with `node index.js`
